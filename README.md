# usth-timetable-node
This is an API to get the data from the timetable of my university

The file is requested at host:port/id=ID&begin=BEGIN&end=END

Where ID is the id of the calendar, BEGIN and END are the beginning and ending of the period you request.
The calendar ids can be found in json/timetable.json

### Developer's note
implement mapping department code to the calendar
